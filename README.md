### Description
You're venturing through life trying to dodge all the unpleasantries to reach your destination.
  - Basic x/y enemy movements that reverse upon reaching screen boundaries
  - Rough implementation of collision detection to check if player and enemy entities are NOT intersecting
  - Movements implemented which movement inputs saved to create smoother movement feel

### Purpose
Just went through a basic pygame tutorial because I wanted to learn more about coding in Python
